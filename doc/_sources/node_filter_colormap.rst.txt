Colormap node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Colormap** node colorizes a grayscale image using a range of colors
produced by sampling a single row or column from another image.

By default, the node samples colors horizontally along the center of the
colormap image. Black pixels in the grayscale image will become the color at
the left edge of this row, white pixels the color at the right edge, and grey
pixels the colors in between.
