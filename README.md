# Material Maker

This is a tool based on [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) that can
be used to create textures procedurally. It can also be used as a Godot addon
(but there's no good reason for not using it as a standalone tool).

Its user interface is based on Godot's GraphEdit node: textures are described
as interconnected texture generators and operators.
