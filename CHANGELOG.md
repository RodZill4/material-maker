  Although it has a lot of limitations, it is a good way of trying Material Maker without
  installing it.

# Material Maker 1.1

## General

- Updated renderer to limit the size of rendering viewports (big textures are rendered in chunks and reassembled).
  This can be used to avoid crashes on lower end GPU and/or when generating high resolution textures. The maximum
  render size can be configured in the progress counter context menu.

  are far from each other).

  of parts of the material).

  the bottom of the user interface.

  and input of the Fill companion nodes.
