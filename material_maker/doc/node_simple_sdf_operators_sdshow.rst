sdShow node
...........

The **sdShow** and **sdShow 2** node convert a signed distance image into a grayscale
image whose background is black and the shape described by its input
is white.

The sdShow 2 node fixes the distance when it is distorted, and consequently generates
shapes with more consistent bevel width.
